After only a few houses, you notice an alarming number of cats about. Some of them even seem to be following you. Well, maybe they think you're their cat deity, you laugh to yourself. A few more houses down and you spot your cat. What the hell? She's supposed to be at home. You better get her back there as soon as possible before one of these weird cats hurts her. You walk up slowly, trying not to startle her, but she runs around the corner of a house. \"Wait! Here kitty kitty! It's time to come home.\" You round the corner after her and find her standing in the middle of a small park for children. Etched into the sand is a strange diagram. She sits at the center expectantly. You carefully squat down next to her and reach to pick her up. Then you see it. You're surrounded by cats of all kinds, their eyes staring intently. Ouch! You look down to see your cat has scratched you. As the blood runs, the other cats draw closer. They begin to yowl and hiss. All at one they pounce, shredding you everywhere. You fall into the sand and your blood pools into the scratched out symbol in the sand. You hear a hissing voice in your head. \"Thank you, human, for being the sacrifice to my great return...\"\n**\"The return of the Goddess BASTET.\"**","category":"gameover","__v":0}

You place some other... sensitive parts made out of candy corn and then you prepare the jolt that will awaken your Candyman. You take the little form into the garage and get the jumpers for the car. After he's been clamped, you rev up the car. Three agonizing tries, and you think you'll have to try again next year...But then... The little candyman lifts it's head. \"IT'S ALIVE\", you shout with glee, laughing like a madman. You walk over to your little frankencandy and it begins to twitch as if in pain. It looks like it's trying to speak. You lean close to try to hear what it's saying. \"Mama?\", it asks questioningly, shuddering. Oh no, something is wrong. As you spot the crack in the back of the lollipop head, it's already too late. Your candychild dies in your hands.\n**\"NOOOO\".....**","category":"gameover","__v":0}
{"_id":{"$oid":"615548a743bd4bf7960b4aba"},"id":176,"content":"\"What do you think, mom?\" you ask as you adjust the ornate mirror on the wall. You're a frequent antique shopper, so you often bring home interesting things. She looks at it with a mock critical eye. \"Lovely.\" You smile wide. Half the reason you do it is because she seems to enjoy what you get. You can't resist a good deal either. You get some Windex and give it a good wipe. As you're dragging the rag over it, you feel something strange. You look into the mirror and it's like your reflection is... doing more than reflecting. It's like it's looking at you. Really looking. You cock your head to the side and peer curiously but you realize how ridiculous that is and head to the kitchen to collect the candy. It's Halloween and you're the designated dealer tonight. You got a little mask to at least have some spirit for the occasion but you just want to enjoy a comfy night at home with some spooky movies. The kids start arriving around 7:30. You put the mask on and pass out candy and costume compliments. Putting the bowl back down, you look into the mirror. Your reflection still seems strange. Do you really have such intense eyes? You sit back down but keep glancing at the mirror from the corner of your eyes. Did it just wink at you? Maybe it's the fact that it's Halloween, or maybe it's the movie but you're spooked. You take it off the wall and throw a blanket over it. A few minutes later you hear a crack. Uh oh. Did you break it while taking it down? You pull the blanket off. It's in pieces. It must be very old. You shake your head. That's a shame, but you do feel a little relieved. A noise in your bedroom caters your eyes to dart down the hall. You go to investigate. You walk into your room and you can't believe your eyes. They look just like you, and they're rifling through your closet. \"Ugly, ugly...Hm not bad.\"\n**You try to back out of the room but your double grabs you, slicing your throat with a shard of mirror.**","category":"gameover","__v":0}

It felt so real. For a long moment you wonder...What if it's not..A dream? Your grandmother used to love telling stories about psychic relatives...You shake your head. Nah. You swing your legs out of bed and get ready for the day. As you eat your breakfast, you can't shake that feeling of dread you felt as you were running through the trees. You know what? There are no woods around here. How would that even happen? Then you look down and notice...You put on the same clothes you were wearing in the dream. Coincidence, obviously. Your parents come into the kitchen, smiling. \"Guess what, honey? We're going camping!\" Oh hell no. You spend 20 minutes arguing with them about not going, too embarrassed to say why. They put their foot down. Now you're in the car. Before you know it you've become a believer in the impossible. The whole drive you're coming up with a plan. Stay near the tents. Don't leave your parent's side. You got this. You set up camp and actually have a pretty good night telling spooky stories and eating s'mores. You all tuck in to the big tent and go to sleep. As you drift off you finally feel relaxed. You made it through the evening. It was just a dream. You hear a loud crack in the woods. You wake up, groggy. Looking around you see your parents are gone. You open the tent and look around but they're nowhere to be found. Their shoes are missing though, so they definitely left on purpose. You call out but get no answer. Behind you a shuffling makes you jump. You look for where it came from and find yourself locked with glowing red eyes. Nope. You take off. As you're running you remember...The dream... You trip; you tumble. Your neck snaps.\n**Too bad seeing the future doesn't change the future.**","category":"gameover","__v":0}

You moved a long way for your job, and you were only able to look at pictures online. It's a bit of a fixer-upper but it's got charm. You don't have to start work until next week, thankfully. That night you listen to the radio and explore. For some reason the basement door won't unlock, even with the key you were given. Hmm, might have to force it open at some point. You try to unscrew the door handle but it's like the damn thing is impervious to manipulation. You sigh and wipe some sweat from your brow. Then you hear a strange noise. You follow it, carefully listening. It's coming from inside the wall. Scratching noises. Damn. Better not be rodents. You suddenly feel very tired and decide to get to sleep. In the middle of the night, the alarm goes off. You look around and find that a window in the kitchen is open. What the hell. You peek outside but see nothing. You don't sleep well the rest of the night. The next morning you get some paint to spruce up the living room color to something that's more you. As you paint, listening to the radio, you think you hear interference in the music. You hold the radio close to your ear. You could swear a voice was saying \"Get out.\" You can't wait til the wifi gets installed so you can just use Spotify. You get onto the ladder and out of nowhere it buckles out from under you. You lay on the floor exhausted and annoyed. It's time for a nap. The bed slumps under you. You've just started to nod off when you hear a sharp noise down the stairs. You run down and the basement is open. Has someone been squatting in the house? You pull our your phone to call the police and something sucks your phone down into the basement. That's it. You bolt for the front door. You pull it open and it slams back shut. You try the window. Halfway out it slams down and cuts you in half like a guillotine. The radio switches on.\n**\"Too late.\"**","category":"gameover","__v":0}

You get to the next job. It doesn't take you long to spot the signs. It's rats, alright. You set up some traps around the house and yard. You can't always avoid the lethal option but it's best to try being nice first. As you're setting up your last trap, you spot one of the buggers watching you from behind a shed. You get your catch bag and creep on over. This rat shows no fear of you. Something seems off about it too. It's a little bigger than most and it's eyes follow you with a strange intelligence. You reach out and think, well if he's just gonna stare at you, why not try to grab him. Your hand gets close and it suddenly screeches, biting you clean through your glove before running off into the bushes. Damn. That's a strong rat. You do some first aid in the truck and tell the owner of the home that you'll be back tomorrow to check the traps. That was your last job for the day, so you head home. As you drive, you notice you're getting a bit of a fever. Sounds and smells seems more powerful and your eyes get sensitive to the light. You think you'll have a fully fledged migraine soon. Getting home by dark, you remark on the beauty of the full moon. You open a beer and settle into your couch, dozing off. You're just about to pass out when you hear a scratching sound behind you. Over your shoulder you see a rat in your window. Did it get in your truck while you were at that house? You get up to go get what you need to catch it, when you notice it's eyes start to glow. The room lights up around you.. But not from the rat's eyes. From yours. You look down and fur starts pushing through your skin. Oh no. Long claws erupt through your fingernails. Your bones start rearranging and expanding; It's excruciating. You look at the rat and watch it change with you. It did this to you.\n**The rage takes over...**","category":"gameover","__v":0}
